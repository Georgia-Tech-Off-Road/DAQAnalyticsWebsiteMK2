For the frontend system, Next.js was chosen. The reason for this is that Next.js provides a more robust routing framework and additional tools that React does not provide. Next.js should provide a more organized approach to better maintain good programming habits. A React based framework was chosen for a couple reasons.
1. React is an industry standard.
1. React is not abstracted beyond recognition from the underlying HTML (unlike, say, Dart)
1. React's UIs are very responsive, good for when there are many moving frontend components.
1. The development team has experience with React
1. React has a robust eco system, desired graphing framework, [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/), integrates seamelssly.
