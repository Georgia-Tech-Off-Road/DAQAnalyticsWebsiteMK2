# Overview
.json data files will be stored locally. All data files will be stored in the backend under the ``/data`` folder. Whenever a new file is uploaded, we create a new folder for it in ``/data``, e.x ``/data/file_name/``. In ``/data/file_name`` will be all files associated with that data file, for example:
 - raw_data_file (unmodified from test)
 - processed_data_file (modified from test)
 - metadata
 - data_file_resolution_1
 - data_file_resolution_2
 - data_file_resolution_n


All of these names above are suggestions for the file use and should not necessarily be taken as the file name for the files.
