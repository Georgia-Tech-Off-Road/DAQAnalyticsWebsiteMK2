# User Data & Authentication
1. The system provides an authentication system to store user data and prevent unathorized users from accessing sensitive datasets
1. The system provides a mean to store previous user "workstates" (the current state of graph settings and data settings)

# Graphing
1. The graphing system must be able to handle our high-resolution datasets with grace, providing some system for levels of detail to handle zooming-in and out
1. The user has the ability to change the layout of their graphs, and their settings (line color, etc.)
1. The user can choose whether to consolidate unit related data into a single graph or seperate graphs. E.x each RPM on their own graph, all together, or two front RPMS and two back RPMS together, etc.

# Data
1. The system provides tools to verify data, checking for corruption and compliance with named data scheme.
1. The system provides tools to "clean-up" data, mark extraneous points for potential removal during graphing, etc.
1. Data can be exported easily to commonly used formats (.csv, later potentially .xlsl).
1. Data views can be shared with other users, and or downloaded and uploaded from local files.

# Analysis
1. Basic analysis tools are provided. Examples of these could include identifying mean, quartiles, extrema. More advanced tools might include identify potential weakness in a part based on strain gauge data
