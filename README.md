# Resources

As you can see, I'm a big fan of Mozilla, one of the first places I look for resources on web development.

## Frontend:
HTML Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Cheatsheet
CSS Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Styling_the_content
JavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/javascript-fundamentals/#network_requests_with_fetch (If you have programming experience you will know pretty much every until section 6.9. 6.9-6.13 are the most useful for learning web development techniques)
## Backend:
Express.js: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
MVC Architecture: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC
